# Introduction #
When I did my 2nd challenge for BootCamp. I thought of a quirky brand for myself which is AnotherPortfolio.
I know that most of my Central Grader are tired of grading every single portfolio so I figured that if I am going to do anything, it will be the concept but better.

My favorite part of any web development project is bring out different color and style. It is completely opposite from web design but I will be consistent on it
